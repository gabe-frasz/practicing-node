## :pushpin: General Information

This is a simple project built exclusively for practising Node.js, following the main idea of SOLID and testing outside of any framework and/or database. So I won't be working on it when it's finished and it will only be used for documentation purposes.

Many thanks to [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) and [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g) for this incredible learning opportunity!
